# Customer-churn-prediction
Process for developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn or attrition. The process involves simple data exploration/analysis before training and testing two models. The specific task is classification, i.e. predicting which customers will churn and which will not. Two models commonly used for classification were chosen: logistic regression and random forest.
